# Machine Learning Project: Income Prediction

This project focuses on predicting income levels using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression and logistic regression models. The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from the `/adult` directory, comprising two main files: `adult.data` and `adult.test`.

## Files:
- `income_prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code implementing the machine learning models, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction tasks.

### Dataset:
**Source:** The dataset used for this project is obtained from the `/adult` directory.
- **Files:**
  - `adult.data`: This file contains the training dataset.
  - `adult.test`: This file contains the testing dataset.

## Models Used:
- **Linear Regression:** Implemented to predict continuous income levels based on various features.
- **Logistic Regression:** Employed to classify income levels into discrete categories based on the provided features.

## Instructions:
1. **Setup:** Ensure that the necessary Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) are installed.
2. **Data Preparation:** Load the dataset (`adult.data` and `adult.test`) into the notebook and perform preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Training:** Utilize the training data to train both the linear regression and logistic regression models.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. **Prediction:** Apply the trained models to the testing dataset (`adult.test`) to predict income levels.
6. **Analysis:** Analyze the results and draw insights into the effectiveness and limitations of the models.

**Note:**
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that all required Python libraries are installed. If any additional dependencies are needed, they should be listed at the beginning of the notebook.
- **Documentation:** Comments and markdown cells should be used throughout the notebook to explain the code, methodology, and insights obtained from the analysis.
- **Further Improvement:** Consider experimenting with other machine learning algorithms, feature selection techniques, or hyperparameter tuning to enhance the model performance.
